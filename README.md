- **Conditional Rendering and Map Method:** Techniques for rendering elements conditionally and iterating over data with the `map` method.
  
## Styling with CSS Modules

- **CSS Modules:** Leveraging CSS Modules to create modular and scoped styles within React applications.

## Advanced Component Handling

- **Passing Components as Children:** Strategies for passing components as children and functions via props.
- **Handling Events:** Efficiently handling user events within React components.

## State Management

- **useState Hook:** Managing state within functional components using the `useState` hook.
- **State vs Props:** Understanding the distinction between state and props, and when to use each.

## Form Handling and Libraries

- **Forms in React:** Best practices for handling forms and form inputs in React.
- **React-Icon Library:** Integrating and using the React-Icon library to enhance user interfaces.

## Advanced React Hooks

- **useRef Hook:** Managing references to DOM elements and preserving values across renders.
- **useReducer Hook:** Implementing complex state logic using the `useReducer` hook.
- **useCallback and useMemo Hooks:** Optimizing performance by memoizing functions and values.
- **Custom Hooks:** Creating reusable custom hooks tailored to specific application needs.

## API Integration

## Routing with React Router

- **React Router Basics:** Setting up Routes, Layout Routes, and handling Navigation within a React application.
- **Advanced Data Handling:** Data fetching with Loaders, submitting data with actions, and managing navigation using the `useNavigate` hook.

## State Management with Redux

- **Redux Fundamentals:** Managing global state across the application using Redux.
- **useSelector and useDispatch Hooks:** Interacting with the Redux store using `useSelector` to read state and `useDispatch` to dispatch actions.
